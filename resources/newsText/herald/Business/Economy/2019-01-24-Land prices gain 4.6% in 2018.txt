Land prices in Seoul and the adjacent Gyeonggi Province expanded 5.14 percent, up from a 3.82 percent hike in 2017, while the growth rate in the rest of the country slowed to 3.65 percent from 3.97 percent.
The border county of Paju, northwest of Seoul, registered the highest on-year growth rate of 9.53 percent amid a thaw in inter-Korean relations and infrastructure projects.
